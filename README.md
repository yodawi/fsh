# fsh
My own implementation of a shell. The fox shell

# running
• To compile use `$ make`

• To start the shell run `$ ./main` (after compiling)

• To exit press `ctrl-d`

• Only compiles for unix (haven't tested in windows, but believe it won't work)


# todo
• Filter history

• Autocompletion

• Syntax hylighting

• .fshrc and all customizations
